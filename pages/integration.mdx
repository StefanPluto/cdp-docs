# Integration

**To be able to integrate with the StopChurn system there is a couple of things you need to do first.**

- Log In to the Back Office platform using the provided credentials from our developer team.
- Create custom table definitions to be able to store data within the StopChurn system.
- Create custom events and bonuses to be used when creating your user journeys.

**The integration process consists of five steps:**

1. Create custom table definitions, events and bonuses (**custom bonuses are optional**).
2. Implement the ability to send event and data updates via your API.
3. Implement the ability to receive webhook calls from the StopChurn system. 
4. Import historical data by extracting it into JSON files, upload them via the Back Office and synchronize the database.
5. Start sending events after the sync process, and you are good to go!

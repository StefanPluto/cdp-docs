# Sending Events

For the StopChurn system to be able to continiously get information about the latest events triggered by the users on your platform,
you will need to send these events via an API call to the StopChurn API.

## Event Data

The required data of an event consists of the following properties:

- `brandId` - The unique identifier of the brand within the StopChurn API.
- `userId` - The userId as the unique identifierof the user that has fired that event.
- `name` - The unique name of the event as defined in the custom event creation page.
- `value` - **Optional**, if the fired event had a value attached to it, it should be sent alongside the event, of the same type as defined in the Custom Event table.

## Sending Event Data Example

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "brandId": 1,
      "userId": "553",
      "name": "ORDER_INITIATED"
    },
    {
      "brandId": 1,
      "userId": "443",
      "name": "CHALLENGE_ENTERED",
      "value": 4000
    }
  ]
}
```

- The data should be sent onto the `/client-data/event` using the POST method, 
with the standard authorization mentioned at the start of the documentation.
- As seen above the data object is an array of events, which means that you are able to either send one or more events at the same time.

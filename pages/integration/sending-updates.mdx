# Sending Updates

For the StopChurn system to be able to continiously get information about the latest updates to the tables that you have defined earlier
you will need to send these updates via an API call to the StopChurn API.

## Update Data

The required data of an event consists of the following properties:

- `type` - The type of the update, which can be either `insert`, `update` or `delete`.
- `data` - The data sent in the same format as when integrating the data for the first time,
with the note that every time this update is sent it needs to contain all of the data that the table definition has, no matter the update type.

## Sending Update Data Example

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "insert",
      "data": {
        "brandId": 1,
        "tableName": "user",
        "data": {
          "id": "1",
          "email": "test123@gmail.com",
          "firstName": "pera",
          "lastName": "peric",
          "nickname": "perke",
          "status": "active",
        },
        "createdAt": 1694357675, // Time of document creation
        "updatedAt": 1694357675 // Time when the document was updated
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "update",
      "data": {
        "brandId": 1,
        "tableName": "user",
        "data": {
          "id": "2",
          "email": "test456@gmail.com",
          "firstName": "mika",
          "lastName": "mikic",
          "nickname": "mikica",
          "status": "active",
        },
        "createdAt": 1694357675,
        "updatedAt": 1694357675
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- The data should be sent onto the `/client-data/update` route using the POST method,
  with the standard authorization mentioned at the start of the documentation.
- As seen above the data object is an array of updates, which means that you are able to either send one or more updates at the same time.

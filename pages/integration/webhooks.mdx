# Sending Updates

As some events will trigger bonuses when being fired, these bonuses will need to be sent to your API as way of notifying your system of a bonus needing to be assigned.

## Bonus Data

The data that will be sent from the StopChurn system for the bonus is:

- `type` - The type of the update, which can be either `insert`, `update` or `delete`.
- `data` - The data sent in the same format as when integrating the data for the first time,
  with the note that every time this update is sent it needs to contain all of the data that the table definition has, no matter the update type.

## Bonus Data received example

```json
{
  "userId": 250,
  "name": "WELCOME_BONUS",
  "value": 100
}
```

- The data will be sent onto your defined Bonus Endpoint concated to the Api Url in the client configuration for your system,
  both the Api Url and the Bonus Endpoint need to be configured before you are able to receive these bonus notifications.
- The webhook request will also contain the `API Token` that you have been assigned as per your client configuration,
 as an additional means of validation in the headers as `Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY}}'`.

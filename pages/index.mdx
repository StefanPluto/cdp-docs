# StopChurn

Welcome to StopChurn, a system designed as a fully agnostic solution for your customer data needs.
It enables the creation of custom entities, events and bonuses within the system with just a few clicks.

## Before you start

Before using the StopChurn API you will need a way to authenticate with the API. Currently there is only one way to do so, which involves utilizing an `API Key`.

The `API Key` identifies you as a client, and should be sent with any request made to the platform inside the headers as:

- `Authorization: 'Bearer {{API_KEY}}'`

**API keys should never be used in a non-backend environment. It is your responsibility to keep your key safe.**
